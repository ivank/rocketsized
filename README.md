# Rocketsized

A small hobby project to list and compare various launch vehicles against one another. I've always seen those rockets lined up side by side but its always a one-off thing, I wanted an automated tool that could do that for any combination of rockets.

Also a way to take a look at and learn elixir and phoenix, which I was unfamiliar with until now.

Project is developed with elixir and phoenix.
